# Heading level 1 YOLOv11n-KL: A Lightweight Tomato Pests and Diseases De-tection Model for Edge Devices
YOLOv11n-KL incorporates three major innovations: (1) the Conv_KW module, which utilizes a cross-layer shared KernelWarehouse (KW). combined with an attention mechanism to dynamically generate convolutional weights for small targets, thereby enhancing feature extraction while reducing computational complexity; (2) the C3k2_KW module, which extends the dynamic kernel concept to multi-branch feature fusion, efficiently reuses kernels to reduce computational complexity while maintain-ing sufficient receptive field coverage; (3) the Detect_LSCD head, a lightweight shared-convolution detection (LSCD) module featuring adaptive multi-scale calibra-tion, which reduces redundancy while ensuring accurate detection of both small and large disease regions. Collectively, these designs enable YOLOv11n-KL to achieve an optimal balance among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, offering a practical solution for real-time edge deployment in intelligent agricultural.
